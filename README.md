## Trudy, a Nabaztag server

Trudy is an alternative [Nabaztag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag) server. Written in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and very easily deployable to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), Trudy is currently configured to support the [Penrillian](http://www.penrillian.com/) build bunny via the [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) [tcWebHooks](http://netwolfuk.wordpress.com/category/teamcity/tcplugins/tcwebhooks/) plugin.

Coming soon: support for iPhony - webhooks as simple as A B C. Webhooks are super powerful and iPhonly is a super webhook client.
